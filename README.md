Excel Coffee Sales Dashboard – End-to-End Data Analysis Project

I recently wrapped up an Excel project where I took a raw coffee sales dataset (2019–2022) and turned it into a clean, interactive dashboard.

The idea was simple: clean messy data → analyze it → visualize insights in a way anyone can understand.

What I Did (My Actual Workflow)
Data Cleaning & Preparation

This was the biggest part of the project. I cleaned and structured the dataset using a combination of Excel formulas and Power Query.

Some key tasks I performed:
Changed inconsistent date formats
Used INDEX-MATCH and XLOOKUP to pull data from multiple sheets
Used IFS to categorize values and create conditional logic
Extracted user names & domain names using text functions like: LEFT(), MID(), FIND(), LEN()
Created useful derived columns.
Handled missing or incomplete records

This gave me a clean, consistent dataset to work with.

Data Analysis
After preparing the data, I focused on understanding overall sales trends and customer patterns:

Monthly & yearly sales trend analysis
Contribution of each country
Top customers and their sales impact
Coffee type comparison (Arabica, Robusta, Liberica, Excelsa)
Order behavior by size & loyalty card

KPI calculations including:
Total Sales: $45,134
Total Orders: 1000
Total Customers: 1000
Avg. Order Value: $45.13
Avg. Order Size: 3.6
All KPIs were created using formulas + calculated fields.

Dashboard Highlights

I built a fully interactive Excel dashboard with:

✔ Slicers (Year, Roast, Country, Size, Loyalty Card)
✔ KPI boxes at the top
✔ A monthly sales trend chart
✔ Top 5 customers bar chart
✔ Sales by country
✔ Coffee type distribution pie chart
✔ Geographic customer distribution

This layout gives a clean, at-a-glance understanding of:
which countries drive revenue
which coffee types perform best
who the top customers are
how sales fluctuate across months/years

Key Insights

Some of the insights I found:
🔹 USA leads with the highest sales — $35,639
🔹 Arabica & Robusta make up more than half of total sales
🔹 Strong seasonality in monthly sales
🔹 Loyalty card users tend to have better average order behavior
🔹 A few customers contribute significantly to overall revenue

🎯 Conclusion
This project was a great hands-on experience in taking raw, unstructured data and turning it into something meaningful.
I really enjoyed combining advanced Excel formulas + Pivot tables + visualization to build a complete analytical workflow.
